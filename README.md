# React Shopping Cart

## Description
Basic shopping cart app that stores data in-memory using an [API](https://github.com/JBallin/g-api) provided by Galvanize (with some modifications). I was given the basic HTML structure and seed data but otherwise built everything on my own.

## Usage
This was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and can be run using:

```shell
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
Note: [API](https://github.com/JBallin/g-api) must be running as well.
